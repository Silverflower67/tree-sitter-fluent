# Tree-sitter grammar for Fluent

A tree-sitter grammar for the Fluent localization language.

While [this](https://github.com/projectfluent/tree-sitter-fluent/) exists, it is not really updated according to modern Tree-sitter standards, so I grabbed their
code and put it in a brand new repo.

## Acknowledgements

Code from the [the original parser](https://github.com/projectfluent/tree-sitter-fluent/) is used in this project. After all, it is just a port to
modern tree-sitter.
